This project details for the data science team at SCIFAA. COVID-19 has been a hot topic since its spread, and with the vaccinations rolled out, the race to get the world to vaccinate is on. With Canada being one of the leading countries to vaccinate its population, this is an opportunity to forecast exactly when every Canadian will be completely vaccinated. Data science tools can greatly help to estimate the point where all those that want both vaccines would get them. Data for the forecast is taken from the database “Our World in Data,” and the population that has received at least one dose of the COVID vaccine till July is taken [1]. Moreover, the reference for the project is the estimation of the vaccination effort in the U.S. [2]. The problems associated with this project are as follow: <br />
•	The target for forecast in the referenced project in the U.S., while this project will cater to Canada<br />
•	The data for analysis is till March 15, while the data to be used in this project is till July<br />
•	In the referenced project, only 59 percent of the population addressed, while in this project, the complete population will be taken into consideration<br />
•	This project will consider the population of vaccinated kids, as, during the experiment of the referenced project, kids at 16 or younger weren’t approved on vaccines<br />
•	This project will also consider the adult population of vaccinated kids, as, during the experiment of the referenced project, a portion of the adult population refused to get the vaccine<br />
•	With the second vaccine being rolled out, the forecast when everyone will have two vaccine doses will also incorporate<br />
