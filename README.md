# Predictive Modeling on Canada COVID Vaccinations
**Data Set**: Share of people who received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. (n.d.). Our World in Data. <br />
**Project**: This project describes a statistical, descriptive, and predictive model using data analysis and data visualization tools to forecast exactly when every Canadian will be completely vaccinated.<br />
**Timeline**: 15 December 2020 to 15 July 2021 <br />
## Approach
### Programming language: R, Python 
### Extracting dataset
- Extraction of COVID-19 vaccination progress all over the world.<br />
- Extract, review and reshape the Canada vaccination data for analysis, and reporting using R.<br />
### Data Analysis and Visualization
- Performed descriptive statistics to identify trends.<br />
- Designed and build data visualizations graphs to provide insights on vaccination trends with respect to each country, gender, and provinces in Canada.<br />
### Data Modelling
- Build descriptive and predictive model based on linear regression to support experimentation.<br /> 
- Predicted the time in the future when every Canadian would get at least 1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.<br />
- Check out folder: "When will Cananda be Vaccinated" and run **Prediction_CA_COVID_Vac.R** in **Code** folder.
### Science Communication
- Created a presentation to provide insights and deliver results in lay words.<br />
- Drafted a detailed report to explain the approach for predictive analysis that is easily understood and replicated. See **Report - When Every Canadian will be Vaccinated.pdf**.<br />


This is a project for a data science internship at the "Science For All Audience" (SCIFAA).
